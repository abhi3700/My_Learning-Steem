## Hive
* [My repo](https://github.com/abhi3700/My_Learning_Hive)
* created as a fork of Steem and born on the core idea of decentralization. Originally, Hive was announced on the Steem blockchain prior to the initial token airdrop.
* The Hive blockchain removes the elements of centralization and imbalanced control that have plagued the Steem blockchain over the last 4 years. Since itâ€™s launch on March 20, 2020 Hive is growing and evolving day by day. Hive's prime selling points are its decentralization, 3 second transaction speed and ability to handle large volumes. It is ideal real estate for a variety of innovative projects focused on a broad range of fields, from open source development to games.
* Hive aims to be the preferred blockchain for dApp development with Smart Media Tokens at its core. With SMTs, everyone can leverage the power of Hive.
